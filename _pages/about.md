I am a 1st year PhD student in the optical sciences program at the University of Arizona. Previously, I received a master's degree in informatics from the University of Tsukuba, where I was advised by [Yoichi Ochiai](https://yoichiochiai.com/) in the [Digital Nature Group](https://digitalnature.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/). Prior to that, I earned a BS in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University with university honors, advised by [Daniel Smalley](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=qN41RegAAAAJ&hl=ja&oi=ao) as a member of the [Electro-Holography Lab](https://www.smalleyholography.org/).

My research centers on photonics and physical informatics—I'm interested in designing interactive cyber-physical systems that leverage integrated optical and mechanical technologies. As a PhD student, my quest is to free the user from the pixel prison of modern technology by building chips that physically process and present information. If you're working in the same space, please feel free to reach out!

In addition to my academic work, I am a [DJ](https://soundcloud.com/keybluemusic) and write [electronic music](https://keyblue.bandcamp.com).

I am a 1st year PhD student in the optical sciences program at the University of Arizona. Previously, I received a master's degree in informatics from the University of Tsukuba, where I was advised by Prof. [Yoichi Ochiai](https://yoichiochiai.com/) in the [Digital Nature Group](https://digitalnature.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/). Prior to that, I earned a BS in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University with university honors, advised by [Prof. Daniel Smalley](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=qN41RegAAAAJ&hl=ja&oi=ao) as a member of the [Electro-Holography Lab](https://www.smalleyholography.org/).

My research is fixed at the nexus of 3D displays and physical informatics—I'm interested in designing interactive photonic systems using physical learning. As a PhD student my quest is to free the user from the pixel prison of modern technology by creating cyber-physical interfaces that autonomously adapt in-situ. My current focus is on guided-wave acousto-optic devices for holographic video and multimodal volumetric displays.

In addition to my academic work, I am a media artist, [DJ](https://soundcloud.com/keybluemusic) and write [electronic music](https://keyblue.bandcamp.com).

My dream is to develop an integrated holographic video display based on acousto-optic modulation with lithium niobate. This so called ["leaky-mode" holography](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12217) is unique compared to other holovideo approaches. Instead of pixelated devices, such as liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulators, leaky-mode holography scans a beam using acoustic diffraction. An analog solution to an analog problem!

Ultimately, I hope to design a near-eye augmented reality display.

In addition to fabrication leaky-mode waveguides, I have experience [simulating](https://keaton.blue/projects/COMSOL/) these kinds of devices too.

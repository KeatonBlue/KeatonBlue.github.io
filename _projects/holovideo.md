The main thrust of my current research is to develop an integrated holographic video display based on acousto-optic modulation with lithium niobate. This so called ["leaky-mode" holography](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12217) is unique compared to other holovideo approaches. Instead of pixelated devices, such as liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulators, leaky-mode holography scans a beam using acoustic diffraction. An analog solution to an analog problem!

Importantly, lithium niobate is also transparent. Ultimately, I hope to design a near-eye augmented reality display. We're working on a new approach that we're very excited about!

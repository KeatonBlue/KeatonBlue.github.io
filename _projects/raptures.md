And now for something a little less academic. I have been writing and performing electronic music since I was in middle school. A byproduct of wanting to write this music was my introduction to electrical engineering. As a middle schooler expensive synthesizers weren't going to buy themselves! So DIY electronics and gameboys would have to suffice.

It's hard to pick one artifact to represent this hobby, but I am still proud of the [RAPTURES EP](https://keyblue.bandcamp.com/album/raptures-ep). Mostly written when I was still in high school, I finally released it on June 25 2020. It is a collection of 4 tracks for the club, written, performed with, and recorded from a Sony Plastation PSP 2000. Made possible by the lovely [LittleGPTracker](https://www.littlegptracker.com/index.php) software and with fantastic cover art by [lxtxcx](https://www.instagram.com/lxtxcx/?hl=it)!

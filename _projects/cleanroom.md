Both in research and in undegraduate coureswork I've completed many projects in a cleanroom environment. These include building MOSFETS from scratch, growing tri-color images using oxide patterning, and fabricating capacitive and piezoeletric transducers. I've used a variety of machines within the cleanroom, including UV lithography (spin coating, alignment, patterning, development, etc), vapor deposition, plasma cleaning, and various optical metrology instruments.

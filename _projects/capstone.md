For our senior capstone project at BYU, our team entered the IEEE AP-S Student Design Contest and won 1st place. Using an antenna array, software defined radio, a handful of raspberry pi's and a projector, we were able to create a display that demonstrated the direction of arrival of a handheld radio emitter, using beamforming. It was a good solidifying experiencing for the electromagnetics study I did as an undergraduate. One of my specific contributions was implementing the visualization code using openframeworks.

In particular, I'm proud of this project because it was during the middle of the pandemic, and our scrappy team of undergraduates managed to take first place over a pool of international graduate teams!

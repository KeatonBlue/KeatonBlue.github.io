During the pandemic as I was waiting to be allowed to enter Japan for graduate school, an interesting opportunity came to me. A friend had started a small online business selling DIY electronics, and he decided to move on and pass it down to me. Thus began a flurry of activity to learn the ropes of a small creative electronics business called [Catskull Electronics](https://catskullelectronics.com/). We sold tools for musicians who used vintage video game hardware. Examples of products included MIDI interfaces for Gameboys and Segas, music albums on a cartridge, and reprogrammable flash cartridges for various systems.

We weren't selling products I designedâ€”instead I worked with others to bring their products to the market. It was really valuable to learn how to put together a personal assembly line, bulk order electronics from China, and of course how to manage finances and customers. I kept the shop going for about two years before wrapping it up to focus on my studies and research.
